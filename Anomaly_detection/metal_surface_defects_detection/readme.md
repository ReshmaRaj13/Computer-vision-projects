# Metal Defect Detection Using Machine Learning
##Overview
This project aims to classify metal defects (e.g., scratches, cracks, bent tips, incomplete welds, and foreign objects) using machine learning models like Random Forest and SVM. The project utilizes features extracted from images using techniques like GLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix), LBP (Local Binary Pattern), and HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients).
